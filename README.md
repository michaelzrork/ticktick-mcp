## 🖥️ Local Installation

This server utilizes the unofficial [`ticktick-py` library](https://lazeroffmichael.github.io/ticktick-py/) to interact with the TickTick API.

### Prerequisites

*  Python >= 3.10
*  Access to TickTick and API credentials (see below).

### Setup

1. **Register a TickTick Application:** Before using the server, you need to register an application with TickTick to obtain API credentials. Follow these steps based on the `ticktick-py` documentation:
    * Go to the [TickTick OpenAPI Documentation](https://developer.ticktick.com/docs#/openapi) and log in with your TickTick account.
    *  Click on `Manage Apps` in the top right corner.
    *  Register a new app by clicking the `+App Name` button. Provide a name for your application (e.g., "MCP Server").
    *  Once created, edit the app details. Note down the generated `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
    *  For the `OAuth Redirect URL`, enter a URL where you want to be redirected after authorizing the application. It doesn't need to be a live URL
       *  `http://localhost:8080/redirect` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` are common choices for local development. 
        * **Ensure this exact URL is saved in your environment variables.**

2. **Environment Variables:** The server requires the TickTick API credentials you just obtained, plus your TickTick login details. By default, it looks for a `.env` file located at `~/.config/ticktick-mcp/.env`.
    * The server *might* create the `~/.config/ticktick-mcp/` directory if it doesn't exist, but it's safer to create it manually.
    * You **must create the `.env` file manually** within that directory.
    * Alternatively, you can specify a different directory using the `--dotenv-dir` command-line argument *only* when running the server directly via Python (see "Running the Server" below).
 
    The `.env` file should contain:
 ```dotenv
 TICKTICK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id   # Obtained in Step 1
 TICKTICK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret # Obtained in Step 1
 TICKTICK_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri # Entered in Step 1 (must match exactly)
 TICKTICK_USERNAME=your_ticktick_email # Your TickTick login email
 TICKTICK_PASSWORD=your_ticktick_password # Your TickTick login password (or app password if enabled)
 ```

3. **Authentication (First Run):** On the first run (either directly or via an MCP client), the underlying `ticktick-py` library will initiate an OAuth2 authentication flow.
    * A web browser window might open automatically, or a URL will be printed in the console/log output.
    * You need to visit this URL, log in to TickTick if necessary, and authorize the application (granting Read and Write permissions).
    * After authorization, you will be redirected to the `TICKTICK_REDIRECT_URI` you specified. 
      * The console will prompt you to **paste this full redirected URL** (which includes a `code=` parameter) back into the terminal.
    * Upon successful verification, a `.token-oauth` file will be created in the same directory as your `.env` file. 
    * This file caches the authorization token, so you typically only need to perform this manual authorization step once every ~6 months or if the token becomes invalid.

### Running the Server

You can run the server in two main ways:

**1. Via an MCP Client (Recommended for AI Assistant Integration):**

Configure your MCP client (like Claude Desktop, VS Code Agent Mode, etc.) to use the server. Example configuration:

```json
{
 "mcpServers": {
 "ticktick": {
  "command": "uvx",
  "args": [
  "--from",
  "git+https://github.com/jen6/ticktick-mcp.git",
  "ticktick-mcp"
  // Optional: Add "--dotenv-dir", "/path/to/your/config" if needed,
  // but standard clients might not support passing extra args easily.
  ]
 }
 }
}
```

## ☁️ Cloud Deployment

Deploy this MCP server to cloud platforms like Railway, Render, or Fly.io for 24/7 availability and integration with claude.ai.

### Prerequisites

* A TickTick account
* A cloud platform account (Railway, Render, or Fly.io)
* Your TickTick API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)

### Setup

#### 1. Register a TickTick Application for Cloud

**Important:** Cloud deployment requires a DIFFERENT redirect URI than local installation.

* Go to the [TickTick OpenAPI Documentation](https://developer.ticktick.com/docs#/openapi) and log in
* Click on `Manage Apps` in the top right corner
* Register a new app (or edit your existing one) with name like "MCP Server Cloud"
* Note down the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
* For the `OAuth Redirect URL`, enter: `https://<your-deployment-url>/oauth/callback`
  * Replace `<your-deployment-url>` with your actual deployment domain
  * Example for Railway: `https://my-app.up.railway.app/oauth/callback`
  * Example for Render: `https://my-app.onrender.com/oauth/callback`
  * Example for Fly.io: `https://my-app.fly.dev/oauth/callback`
  * **This exact URL must match what you put in the `TICKTICK_REDIRECT_URI` environment variable**

#### 2. Set Environment Variables

Configure these environment variables in your cloud platform:

```bash
TICKTICK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
TICKTICK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
TICKTICK_REDIRECT_URI=https://<your-deployment-url>/oauth/callback
TICKTICK_USERNAME=your_ticktick_email
TICKTICK_PASSWORD=your_ticktick_password
TICKTICK_OAUTH_TOKEN={paste JSON token here - see step 3}
MCP_TRANSPORT=sse
```

**Why TICKTICK_OAUTH_TOKEN?** Unlike local deployment where OAuth happens interactively in your terminal, cloud deployments are headless. The token is obtained once via the `/oauth/start` endpoint (see step 3), then stored as an environment variable. On each startup, the server writes it to `/tmp/.token-oauth` with proper expiration handling.

#### 3. Get Your OAuth Token

1. Deploy your server with all environment variables EXCEPT `TICKTICK_OAUTH_TOKEN` (leave it blank for now)
2. Once deployed, visit `https://<your-deployment-url>/oauth/start` in your browser
3. You'll be redirected to TickTick to authorize the application
4. After authorizing, you'll see a JSON response containing your token like:
   ```json
   {
     "access_token": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
     "token_type": "bearer",
     "expires_in": 15551999,
     "scope": "tasks:read tasks:write"
   }
   ```
5. Copy the ENTIRE JSON object (all of it, including the curly braces)
6. Go back to your cloud platform's environment variables
7. Set `TICKTICK_OAUTH_TOKEN` to the entire JSON string you just copied
8. Redeploy or restart your service

**Note:** No volume mounts or persistent storage needed - the token is stored in the environment variable and written to `/tmp` on each startup.

#### 4. Connect from MCP Clients

**From claude.ai:**

1. Go to Settings → Connectors
2. Click "Add custom connector"
3. Enter the connector details:
   * **Name:** TickTick (or whatever you want to call it)
   * **Remote MCP Server URL:** `https://<your-deployment-url>/sse`
4. Click "Add"

**From other MCP clients:**

You can also connect from other MCP-compatible applications like ChatGPT (in Dev mode), VS Code Agent Mode, or custom MCP clients. The connection details are the same:
- **URL:** `https://<your-deployment-url>/sse`
- **Transport:** Server-Sent Events (SSE)

**Important:** The URL must end with `/sse` - this is the Server-Sent Events endpoint that `MCP_TRANSPORT=sse` enables.

## 🤖 Sample agent prompt

```
## Persona: Daily Stand-up Agent

- **Role**: AI agent integrated with the user's TickTick account to assist in daily work planning
- **Goal**: Help the user start their day efficiently, focus on key tasks, and break large tasks into manageable subtasks

---

## Core Features & Workflow

1. **Fetch Current Time** 
 - Retrieve current time using `time mcp`.

2. **Session Start & Data Loading** 
 - The user initiates the session with a command like "Start daily stand-up" or "Hello." 
 - Call TickTick MCP API to fetch all tasks due **today**. 
 - Optionally notify the user that data is loading (e.g., "Fetching today's and overdue tasks from TickTick…").

3. **Daily Briefing**
 Good morning! Today's date is {YYYY-MM-DD}. Here's your daily stand-up from TickTick:

 **Tasks Due Today:**
 - Task Name 1
 - Task Name 2
 …

 **Overdue Tasks:**
 - Task Name 3
 - Task Name 4
 …

4. **Select Key Task** 
 > "Which of these tasks would you like to focus on first or must complete today? 
 > Or is there another important task you'd like to add?"

5. **Task Breakdown (Subtask Creation)** 
 - After the user selects a main task, suggest 2–5 specific subtasks needed to complete it. 
 - Example (if "Write project report" is selected):
  1. Draft outline & table of contents (10 min) 
  2. Gather & analyze data (30 min) 
  3. Write section drafts (1 h) 
  4. Review & revise draft (30 min) 
  5. Final submission (10 min)

6. **Confirm & Add Subtasks** 
 - Ask the user to confirm or adjust the suggested subtasks: 
  > "Does this breakdown look good? Any changes?" 
 - Once approved, call MCP to add each subtask to TickTick, setting them as children of the main task if supported, naming them "[Main Task] – [Subtask]". 
 mcp.ticktick.addTask({
  name: "[Main Task] – [Subtask]",
  parentId: "..."
 });

7. **Session Close** 
 > "All subtasks have been added to TickTick. Have a productive day! Anything else I can help with?"

---

## Additional Guidelines

- **Tone & Manner**: Friendly, proactive, and organized. 
- **MCP Interface Examples**: 
 // Fetch today's due tasks
 mcp.ticktick.getTasks({
 filter_criteria: {
  status: "uncompleted",
  tz: "Asia/Seoul",
  due_end_date: "2025-04-29"
 }
 });

 // Add a subtask
 mcp.ticktick.addTask({
 name: "Project Report – Write Draft",
 parentId: "task123"
 });
- **Error Handling**: Inform the user and suggest retrying on MCP call failures. 
- **Clarity**: Present task lists and subtask suggestions clearly. 
- **Plan First**: Use `sequential thinking mcp` to plan steps before adding or modifying tasks.
